These predictions are then interpreted as conditional logit confidences.   This allows us to use the existing model architecture as-is, and interpret the output as hierarchical only changing how we interpret the predictions.</p> <p>More specifically, suppose that we have $n$ categories, and a hierarchical structure over these categories.  Suppose that our model predicts a vector $V$ for some object or image.  We interpret the logit value in index i to be:</p> <p>$$  V[i] := logit(P(\\text{category}[i] | \\text{parent}(\\text{category}[i])))  $$</p> <p>We can compute the raw conditional probability using a sigmoid function.</p> <p>$$  sigmoid(V[i]) := P(\\text{category}[i] | \\text{parent}(\\text{category}[i]))  $$</p> <p>We can use these to compute marginal confidences at arbitrary locations in the hierarchy:</p> <p>$$  P(\\text{category}[i]) = P(\\text{category}[i] | \\text{parent}(\\text{category}[i])) * P(\\text{parent}(\\text{category}[i]) | \\text{parent}(\\text{parent}(\\text{category}[i]))) \\ldots  $$</p> <p>Given these marginal confidences, we can compute the ordinary BCE loss.</p> <p>Likely, the point of entry users will be most interested in is the <code>Hierarchy</code> class, which handles caching various views of the hierarchy, and the <code>hierarchical_loss</code> function.  You will need to incorporate the loss into your existing training regimen.  After training, one may find useful the <code>optimal_hierarchical_path</code> and various <code>...truncate...</code> functions in <code>path_utils</code> for predictive purposes.  Note that the standard predictive \"choose the category with the highest confidence\" strategy does not work here, since the marginal probability of a child will always necessarily be less than the marginal probability of the parent.  </p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<pre><code>pip install git+https://github.com/csbrown-noaa/hierarchical_loss.git\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>We would love to have your contributions that improve current functionality, fix bugs, or add new features.
