def hierarchical_loss(
    pred: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, hierarchy_index: torch.Tensor
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Computes a hierarchical cross-entropy loss.

    This function interprets the raw `pred` logits as representing the
    log-odds of the *conditional* probability `P(category | parent)`.
    It then calculates the *marginal* probability `P(category)` by
    multiplying all conditional probabilities along the ancestor path.

    This multiplication is done in log-space for numerical stability.

    The loss is a variant of binary cross-entropy, calculated as:
    `-[t * log(s) + (1-t) * log(1-s)]`
    where:
    - `t` is the expanded target (1 for the node and all ancestors, 0 otherwise).
    - `s` is the *marginal* probability, `P(category)`.
    - `log(s)` is `sum(log(P(ancestor | parent_of_ancestor)))`, which is
      computed by `accumulate_hierarchy`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pred : torch.Tensor
        The raw logit predictions from the model, with shape `(B, D, N)`,
        where `N` is the number of classes.
    targets : torch.Tensor
        The one-hot target tensor, with shape `(B, D, N)`.
    hierarchy_index : torch.Tensor
        An int tensor of shape `(N, M)` mapping each node `i` to its
        ancestral path `[i, parent, grandparent, ...]`.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        A tensor of the same shape as `pred` containing the loss
        value for each prediction.
